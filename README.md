# RALM_Survey
This is a repository of RALM surveys containing a summary of state-of-the-art RAG and other technologies according to according to our survey paper: [From Intuition to Rationality: A Survey on Retrieval-augmented Language Model in Natural Language Processing]() . In this repository, we will present the most central research approach of our thesis as well as keep up-to-date with work on RALM in the most accessible way possible. For more detailed information, please read our papers. Please cite our papers if you think they can help you with your research!

## Overview
This SURVEY of ours summarizes multiple aspects of RALM, including: definition, retriever, LM, enhancement, data source, application, evaluation, and more.
*We hope this repository can help researchers and practitioners to get a better understanding of RALM.
